 * Interface common to heap data structures.<br>
 * <p>Heaps are tree-like data structures that allow storing elements in a specific
 * way. Each node corresponds to an element and has one parent node (except for the root) and
 * at most two children nodes. Every element contains a key, and those keys
 * indicate how the tree shall be built. For instance, for a min-heap, the key of a node shall
 * be greater than or equal to its parent's and lower than or equal to its children's (the opposite rule applies to a
 * max-heap).</p>
 * <p>All heap-related operations (inserting or deleting an element, extracting the min or max) are performed in
 * O(log n) time.</p>
