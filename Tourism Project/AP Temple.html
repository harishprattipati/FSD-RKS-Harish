	<p>The ancient Sri Kodanda Rama Swamy temple at Vontimitta in Kadapa district is gearing up for the nine-day annual Brahmotsavams from March 25.<br><br>

The festivities will begin with ‘ankurarpanam’ on March 24. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, which has taken over the temple, has made elaborate arrangements as tens of thousands of devotees from surrounding districts also throng the temple.<br><br>

Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan and Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu are expected to take part in Sri Seetharama kalyanotsavam on March 30. The deities of Sri Sita Lakshmana Sameta Sri Ramachandra Murthy in the temple were said to be consecrated by Sri Jambavantha in Tretayugam. During his exile, Lord Sri Rama visited this place along with Sita Devi and Lakshmana Swamy. To quench the thirst of Sita, Sri Rama threw an arrow into the earth and water pierced out. This water body is now popularly known as ‘Rama Theertham’ located adjacent to the temple.

	<br>
	<p>Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Board has decided to close the temple of Lord Venkateshwara from August 11 to August 16 in view of Astabandhana Balalaya Mahasamprokshanam, a unique religious fete for a for a comprehensive cleaning of the temple. This is the first time ever that the temple will remain closed for pilgrims.</p>
	<p>Briefing the media persons at Annamaiah Bhavan in Tirumala on Saturday after the emergency Board Meeting, TTD Board Chairman Putta Sudhakar Yadav said that the unique religious fete takes place once in 12 years in Tirumala shrine.</p>
	<p>"This religious fete commences with Ankurarpanam on August 11. The holy fete commences on August 12 and concludes on August 16. As importance given to vedic rituals inside the temple, time for providing darshan to pilgrims will be very minimal. Our past history speaks that during the second week of August last, over 5.5 lakh pilgrims visited the hill temple. Keeping this in view, we have decided to dispense with darshan to avoid hardships to pilgrim and devotees," Yadav reiterated.</p>
	<p>"We therefore request the pilgrim devotees of Lord Venkateswara present across the globe to plan their pilgrimage accordingly," Yadav appealed to pilgrims via media.</p>
